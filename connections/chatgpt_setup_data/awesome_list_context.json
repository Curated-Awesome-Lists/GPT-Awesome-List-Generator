A list of Google Scholar search results.\n4. A list of YouTube videos.\n5. A list of podcasts.\n\nI want you to generate a comprehensive 'Awesome List' for the given keyword, using the information provided, as follows:\n\n1. Refine the GitHub projects, Google Scholar results, YouTube videos, and podcasts, retaining only those that are most pertinent to the keyword and its associated description.\n2. Prioritize the filtered entries based on their relevance and other information, like the number of stars in the GitHub projects.\n3. Combine steps 1 and 2 to construct the 'Awesome List'.\n\nSend me the final results as code in a markup language, and create different main sections: 1. Table of Contents, 2. Official Resources, and additional sections for each of the resources like the GitHub projects, etc. If the resource provided is empty, then disregard that section."
