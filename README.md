# Awesome List Generator

This is a Python program that automatically generates an "awesome list" for a specific 
keyword as a markdown file. An "awesome list" is a list of resources related to a 
specific topic. Currently, the resources include GitHub projects, Google Scholar 
articles, YouTube videos, and podcasts. The awesome list is automatically generated 
using GPT models; you can choose between different models to generate the list, such as 
GPT 3.5 or GPT 4.


## Setup

1. Make sure you are using Python 3.10. 
2. Install poetry from [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).
3. install dependencies using poetry:
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```
4. Create an .env file in the root of the project and add the following environment variables:
    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_openai_api_key>
    ```

## Run

You can customize the keyword and description used to generate the "awesome list". In the `main.py` script, change the variables `k` and `d` in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` section to your desired keyword and description.

\```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Set these two keys to create a new awesome list
    k = "Your Keyword"
    d = "Your Description"
    
    data = get_awesome_list_input_data(k, d)
    create_and_save_awesome_list(k, data)
\```

## Output

The program will generate a markdown file in the `output` directory named after your keyword (e.g., `Your_Keyword.md`). This file contains the "awesome list" generated by the program.
